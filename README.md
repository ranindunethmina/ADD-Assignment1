Introduction to Serialization and Deserialization
Serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, such as a byte stream, XML, or JSON. Deserialization is the reverse process, where the stored or transmitted data is converted back into an object. These processes are fundamental in various applications, including data storage, communication between systems, and deep copying of objects.

Benefits of Serialization and Deserialization

Efficient Communication: Serialized data can be easily transmitted over networks, enabling seamless communication between different systems and platforms.

Performance Optimization: Serialized objects can be cached to enhance performance by avoiding repetitive computations.

Interoperability: Serialized data can be exchanged between different programming languages and systems, promoting interoperability.

State Preservation: Serialization allows for creating deep copies of objects, which is beneficial in scenarios requiring object state preservation.

Persistent Storage: Objects can be saved to files or databases and restored later, maintaining their state across sessions.

Mechanism of Serialization and Deserialization

Serialization:

The object is converted into a suitable format for storage or transmission.
This involves writing the object's state to a byte stream or another appropriate format.
In Java, this is typically accomplished using ObjectOutputStream for byte streams.

Deserialization:

The stored or transmitted data is read and converted back into an object.
This involves reconstructing the object from the serialized data.
In Java, this is typically achieved using ObjectInputStream for byte streams.
